# Web Project Assets
This is a repo for all web project assets used by Developer's Club.

## Sticky Notes:

This is a list of some libraries and frameworks we will be using very soon:

1. HTML / CSS / JQuery (prerequisites)
2. Materialize CSS (https://materializecss.com/) *optional
3. Sass (any Sass compiler. search online. example, Koala : http://koala-app.com/)
4. Bootstrap v4.1

## How to use this repo

Project goals will be posted in README.md visible on Github repo home. Everyone is encouraged to create a Github account and download the Github Desktop (https://desktop.github.com/) before proceeding.

Everything (i.e, all libraries like jquery, bootstrap, materializecss, etc.) will be included in *general_assets* folder by default. Make use of those from the folder itself and also do not attempt to modify any of those files.

1. Clone the repository to your Github Desktop.
2. Create a new branch with your name
3. Make Commits only to your branch (not the master branch)
4. Report back upon completion of task

After all tasks are submitted and checked, the job of the moderator will be to sort out the conflicts between branch codes and finally merge the branches into the master with a single commit.

New tasks will then be posted and everyone will get going again.
